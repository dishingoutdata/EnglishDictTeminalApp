# English Dictionary Terminal Application

This application is loaded through the terminal of your computer and is used to find the definition(s) of all the words in the English language dictionary.
The user enters a word and gets the definition(s) as the output. I have also included a separate program that utilizes SQL and a MySQL to demonstrate how to query a database for a definition instead of downloading a file. The advantage of using a database rather than a huge file is that it saves space on the computer as well as decrease runtime for the application. I included a database in the repository that you can load into MySQL and use for your program.   

To use the application:
1) Download both the 'data.json' file and 'EnglishDictTerminalApp.py' file into a new directory.
2) Open the terminal.
3) Run the 'EnglishDictTerminalApp.py' program.
